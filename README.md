# Clustering Music Genres with Machine Learning

Problem Statement :
                   Every person has a different taste in music. We cannot identify what kind of music does a person likes by just knowing about their lifestyle, hobbies, or profession. So it is difficult for music streaming applications to recommend music to a person. But if we know what kind of songs a person listens to daily, we can find similarities in all the music files and recommend similar music to the person.
That is where the cluster analysis of music genres comes in. Here you are given a dataset of popular songs on Spotify, which contains artists and music names with all audio characteristics of each music. Your goal is to group music genres based on similarities in their audio characteristics.
